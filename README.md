# PERFORMING_EDA_task-2
**Introduction**

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. Early diagnosis plays a vital role in improving survival rates and treatment outcomes.
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset to understand patterns, trends, and correlations among various tumor features.

EDA helps to visualize relationships between attributes, identify key features distinguishing benign and malignant tumors, and detect anomalies or data quality issues before applying machine learning models.

The dataset contains 30 features (e.g., radius, texture, smoothness, symmetry) derived from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. Each record is labeled as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

# How It Works

The project uses a structured EDA workflow to explore and visualize the dataset:

Step 1: Data Loading -Load the Breast Cancer dataset using sklearn.datasets.


Step 2: Data Inspection- Display dataset structure, shape, and data types.


Step 3: Descriptive Statistics


Step 4: Data Visualization-  Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to plot histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.

Step 5: Correlation Analysis

Step 6: Outlier Detection

Step 7: Hypothesis Testing

Step 8: Relationship Analysis


# How to run

1. open the notebook in google colab using the given link below
2. run the program
3. Visualizations like histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps will appear as graphical plots.

# ðŸ§ Conclusion

The EDA process helps uncover critical insights from the Breast Cancer dataset:

Certain features like mean radius, mean area, and mean perimeter are strong indicators of malignancy.

Visualizations reveal clear differences in feature distributions between benign and malignant tumors.

This analysis lays a solid foundation for building an accurate machine learning model for breast cancer classification.
